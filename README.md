First, The most interesting thing was that the GitHub and the computer's terminal were directly connected and operated.
To practice using Git in a MacOS environment, I installed and ran Git, but the initial setting was not smooth. Working on the Mac built-in terminal was also quite difficult. Even if an error occurred, it was difficult to know what's wrong, and there were cases where it was difficult to use the method because the OS was different.
The most difficult things were commit and push. First, the concept of commit itself was unfamiliar. One obstacle was the complexity of committing, where the changes did not apply immediately. There were some areas to be overcome, such as when the commit was not working properly even though the changes were made. Push for interworking with GitHub was also not easy. The concept of "clone" and "local" was understood with my head, but the more I worked, the more I was confused. Crucially, I suffered trial and error in this part, such as forcing a push because the push was not done properly. In addition, it was also a challenge that "Already up to date" continued to occur in the branch merge.
What I felt while learning the basics through the Git practice is that, of course, coding is difficult, but handling files in a text-based UI is more difficult than GUI environment. Last but not least, I thought that Git is very collaboration-friendly in many ways, considering its system such as commit messages etc.
